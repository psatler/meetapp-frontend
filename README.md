# Meetapp Frontend

> Frontend of the [meetapp backend app](https://github.com/psatler/meetapp-backend)

The frontend web is dedicated for meetup organizers and does not have subscription feature.
So, the organizers can create the meetup and set up its pieces of information, like where it is taking place, banner photo, etc.

This project has ESLint and Prettier configured as its linter and formatting tools respectively along with tools like Redux and Redux Saga, and Reactotron.
